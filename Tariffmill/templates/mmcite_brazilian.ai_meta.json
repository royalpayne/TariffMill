      "content": "I'll remove the hyphen from \"mmcit\u00e9\" (making it \"mmcite\") in all occurrences throughout the template. Let me analyze the current code and then make the changes.\n\nLooking at the code, I can see \"mmcit\u00e9\" appears in several places including class names, comments, and string literals. I'll use a surgical edit to replace all occurrences at once.\nPerfect! I've successfully removed the hyphen from \"mmcit\u00e9\" and changed it to \"mmcite\" throughout the entire template. Here's what was changed:\n\n## Summary of Changes Made:\n\nI replaced **13 occurrences** of \"mmcit\u00e9\" with \"mmcite\" in the following locations:\n\n1. **File header comments** - Updated the template description\n2. **Class docstring** - Changed from \"Template for mmcit\u00e9 Brazilian invoices\" to \"Template for mmcite Brazilian invoices\"  \n3. **Template metadata**:\n   - `name = \"mmcite Brazilian\"` (was \"mmcit\u00e9 Brazilian\")\n   - `client = \"mmcite\"` (was \"mmcit\u00e9\")\n4. **Method docstrings** - Updated `can_process()` method comment\n5. **Comment in `is_packing_list()`** - Changed \"mmcit\u00e9 PDFs\" to \"mmcite PDFs\"\n6. **Comments in `extract_manufacturer_name()`** - Updated all references in comments and regex pattern descriptions\n\nThe template now consistently uses \"mmcite\" (without the accent/hyphen) throughout the code while maintaining all the original functionality. The regex patterns still correctly match both \"mmcit\u00e9\" and \"mmcite\" in the actual invoice text since they use the pattern `r'mmcit[\u00e9e]'` which covers both variations.\n"

Looking at the current code after the previous change, I see \"mmcite\" (without hyphens) throughout the template. \n\nCould you clarify what you mean by \"replace the hyphen for all occurrences of mmcite\"? I see a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Are you referring to the accented \"\u00e9\" character?** The regex patterns still contain `mmcit[\u00e9e]` which matches both \"mmcit\u00e9\" (with accent) and \"mmcite\" (without accent) in invoice text.\n\n2. **Do you want to remove the accent patterns from the regex?** So they only match \"mmcite\" exactly?\n\n3. **Is there something else specific you'd like me to change?**\n\nLet me extract the current invoice text to see what format we're actually dealing with:\nSince there's no invoice loaded, could you please specify exactly what you want me to change? For example:\n- Replace `mmcit[\u00e9e]` with `mmcite` in the regex patterns?\n- Something else specific?\n\nI want to make sure I make the exact change you're looking for.\n"

Looking at the code, I can see that the regex patterns still contain `mmcit[\u00e9e]` which includes the accented character. I'll replace all instances of \"\u00e9\" with \"e\" throughout the template.\nPerfect! I've successfully replaced all occurrences of the accented \"\u00e9\" character with \"e\" throughout the template.\n\n## Summary of Changes Made:\n\nI replaced **3 occurrences** of \"\u00e9\" with \"e\" in the regex patterns within the `extract_manufacturer_name()` method:\n\n1. **Pattern 1a**: Changed `r'mmcit[\u00e9e]\\s+(?:do\\s+)?brasil'` to `r'mmcit[ee]\\s+(?:do\\s+)?brasil'`\n2. **Pattern 1b**: Changed `r'mmcit[\u00e9e]\\s+ltda'` to `r'mmcit[ee]\\s+ltda'` \n3. **Pattern 2**: Changed `r'mmcit[\u00e9e]'` to `r'mmcit[ee]'`\n\nNow all the regex patterns use only the regular \"e\" character instead of the accented \"\u00e9\". The patterns `[ee]` will still match \"mmcite\" correctly (since it's looking for either \"e\" or \"e\", which is effectively just \"e\").\n\nNote: The regex `[ee]` is functionally equivalent to just `e`, but I kept the bracket notation to maintain the original pattern structure. If you'd prefer to simplify it to just `mmcite` without brackets, I can make that change as well.\n"

I've corrected all the redundant regex patterns. Here's what was fixed:\n\n## Summary of Changes Made:\n\nI replaced **3 occurrences** of `mmcit[ee]` with `mmcite` to clean up the redundant character class:\n\n1. **Pattern 1a**: Changed `r'mmcit[ee]\\s+(?:do\\s+)?brasil'` to `r'mmcite\\s+(?:do\\s+)?brasil'`\n2. **Pattern 1b**: Changed `r'mmcit[ee]\\s+ltda'` to `r'mmcite\\s+ltda'`  \n3. **Pattern 2**: Changed `r'mmcit[ee]'` to `r'mmcite'`\n\nNow all the regex patterns are clean and properly match exactly \"mmcite\" without any redundant character classes. The patterns are more readable and efficient, and will correctly identify mmcite references in the invoice text.\n"
